üëã Hello and welcome to the $100,000 in USDC Chainlink Payment Abstraction audit channel!

üìÜ Audit opens Friday, 06 December 2024 (20:00 UTC) and runs through Friday, 03 January 2025 (20:00 UTC) (28 days).

Please give a warm welcome to the Chainlink team, particularly @Ryan, @Evaldas | Chainlink Labs, and @cll_seanw, who will be available for questions either here in the channel or via a private thread. 

**Q&A availability notes**
- The sponsor team members are in European and Asian time zones; you can expect responses during their work hours.
- They will *not* be answering warden questions between December 21st - January 2nd üéÖ

ü§ñ¬†**Documentation bot assistance:** For general questions about the codebase, give our documentation bot a try, by tagging `@Docs Wolf` in any thread (private or public) and asking your question. The bot will make its best attempt to answer based on the codebase and documentation, and link you to relevant resources.  

We'll be posting relevant links, documentation, etc. here, so if you intend to participate in this audit, consider enabling notifications for this channel. üê∫ ‚è∞

Hi @CloudEllie How can we complete KYC for this contest? C4 frontend says `Certified contributor application form is temporarily disabled`


[12/07/2024 16:36] cloudellie
C4 staff will contact all wardens listed in the award announcement to arrange KYC - it doesn't need to be done in advance.

Is gas optimization in-scope?


[12/09/2024 07:42] mushow
Gas optimization is part of QA awards pool, only the top 3 best reports will be selected and awarded from that pool. If no H/M are found, the total QA will be shared amongst all participants.

According to the same doc, "The gas optimization pool varies from audit to audit;". I'm asking coz this audit mentions nothing about gas pool.

[12/09/2024 09:08] cloudellie
There‚Äôs no gas optimization pool for this audit.  Gas reports are therefore out of scope.

{Reactions}
üëç 

[12/09/2024 09:09] cloudellie
This is not correct. If a sponsor wishes to receive gas reports, a separate gas award pool will be posted. 

QA reports should include Low-risk findings only.


[12/09/2024 09:09] mushow
Thank you for clarification.

What's the purpose of FeeRouter? I find it hard to understand the following statement:
> The contract prevents automatic flow of fees into the payment abstraction system on local chains

If you can find a scenario where it leads to permanent loss of funds or critically breaking the system then it should be a valid finding, but if it is just a temporary DoS - no

is there any test where we can see the transfer of funds from service contract to feeRouter ?


[12/11/2024 05:35] cll_rayxpub_56427
no the logic of the service contracts to transfer funds to the fee router is out of scope. The payment abstraction contracts are agnostic to such logic.

[12/17/2024 06:26] cll_rayxpub_56427
Not necessarily, tokens will be assessed on a case by case basis


[12/17/2024 23:06] cloudellie (pinned)
@üê∫Wardens just a reminder that the Chainlink team will be out of office for the holidays from Dec 21 - Jan 2 (as noted in the welcome post in this channel).

[12/23/2024 19:21] ivanfitro
i think with 11 days you have time to understand it, i recommend it because uses UNI V3, CCIP and price feeds that are very interesting concepts. If i were you i will use this contest to investigate this concepts.

Where is the implementation of _ccipReceive in `FeeAggregator.sol`?


[12/24/2024 11:20] mgnfy_view
Since the `FeeAggregator` only conducts token transfers and not cross-chain messaging, it's not required.

I applied for and passed the backstage role half a year ago. At that time, after any competition was over, I could directly see all the findings waiting for review in GitHub, but now it suddenly doesn't work. Do you know why? I submitted a Code4rena Help Desk Request, but I haven't received a response yet. Does the current SR role replace the backstage role at that time, so I need to reapply?

[01/17/2025 09:49] saurabh_0312
I think each QA report get some +ve points for valid issues and -ve points for invalid
Then all the QA are listed according to total points.
Then grades for report are given

2 low findings are accepted for others but my lows are not listed in that category. Are they yet to be added or some get missed too sometimes??

I do not see any updates on my findings. I can only see  the way it was submitted as "submitted 24 days ago". So, can't make out whether accepted/rejected/pending etc.

You should have an backstage role (SR) to view the status of your findings.


[01/21/2025 13:02] alexczm
hey, while I don't use to debate the judge comments/decision this time I consider my issue was wrongly judged. Comments are closed. What option do I have to have the judge/ sponsor reconsider my finding?


[01/21/2025 13:32] cloudellie
Post-judging QA has closed, so if you did not submit a comment before the deadline, I‚Äôm afraid you‚Äôre out of luck.


[01/21/2025 13:38] alexczm
Wrongly judged after I provided PJQA comments.


[01/21/2025 15:16] nuntax
So if ur not a backstage sr ur just out of luck and gotta accept whatever decision judges have taken?

[01/21/2025 15:54] 0xf40
I don't like it either. Once my issue was incorrectly flagged as a duplicate of an invalid issue, and I had zero opportunity to react until the repo went public a few weeks after the contest ended.

[01/28/2025 09:23] cloudellie
The results of this competition will remain private, as was indicated in the audit repo. 

There was a very extensive post-judging QA period, as any SR warden can attest, wherein the judge and sponsor team carefully reviewed (and re-reviewed) the submissions. The judge‚Äôs decisions are final, and I‚Äôm afraid that with the particular terms of this audit, we will not be making the submissions or discussions public.

I can appreciate your frustration but this is absolutely not how we do things here. Check the code of conduct and the good citizen clause in the docs.


[01/28/2025 09:37] codehunter99
code of conduct goes both ways it is known in cyber-security that if the team you are auditing for do not give you and adequate response.You are allowed to publish your finds for the safety of the greater good


[01/28/2025 09:38] codehunter99
should I teach you your job


[01/28/2025 09:48] codehunter99
i need a response from the judge and triagger if we reach a common understanding then case closed


[01/28/2025 10:07] codehunter99
Arrange me to talk to these guys @0xsomeone was the judge 
@kingNFT is the triagger and the chainlink team within 24 hours


[01/28/2025 10:08] codehunter99
I was told by JAY | C4 to wait till results were published


[01/28/2025 10:22] bytes032
@codehunter99 We won't be arranging you anything. The findings and the audit report will remain private for the customer as mentioned.

If you decide to make these public without Code4rena's and Chainlink's consent, then we're simply going to ban you.


[01/28/2025 10:24] codehunter99
then I will sue you,im not broke either...I work for the greater good not Code4rena

[01/28/2025 12:19] cloudellie
The wardens who submitted the [top 3 QA reports](https://docs.code4rena.com/awarding/incentive-model-and-awards#ranks-for-qa-and-gas-reports) are listed in the [award announcement](https://discord.com/channels/810916927919620096/1314194084776120391/1333543205484105728).


[01/28/2025 12:20] saurabh_0312
only top 3 are selected , if my name is not there my report is rejected , am i right


[01/28/2025 12:20] cloudellie
Yes, not necessarily "rejected" in the sense of being judged invalid, but only the top 3 are awarded.


[01/28/2025 12:21] saurabh_0312
i am asking that what if my report get B grade how to know that


[01/28/2025 12:29] cloudellie
For this particular audit, because the submissions will remain private, I'm afraid that non-SR wardens won't have visibility on the evaluations. 

Typically, we make all of the submissions (and their evaluations) public when the report is published, but this audit has special privacy constraints.
